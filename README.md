# Spin-Orbit-Coupling-Source-Code
Analysis Code for "Superconducting Tunneling Spectroscopy of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Orbital Depairing in Nb:SrTiO3 "

I have uploaded a Jupyter notebook containing the analysis source code (python 2) for our paper published in PRL last october (Swartz, et al., PRL 121, 167003 (2018)) in which we published our results on the superconducting tunneling spectrum of Nb-doped SrTiO3 thin films in the 2D superconducting limit. The tunneling spectra is numerically fit using Maki's theory, a non-linear regression problem in the complex plane. The Notebook contains the source code as well as an example of the code in action, and a brief summary of the combined fitting results which were not included in the supplementary material of the published manuscript.
